# Powerplant coding challenge

This code is a submission to the Powerplant Coding Challenge from [gem-paas](https://github.com/gem-spaas/powerplant-coding-challenge)

A REST API can be used to obtain a solution to a production plan given the available power plants, their capacities, efficiency, and the cost of fuel for each power plant.

To use the API, you may make use of [postman](https://www.postman.com/). Adress the api at /productionplan with a json file as raw body.

Both the REST API and the underlying code were written in Python version 3.9.5.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you first need to install Python, which you can download  [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Furthermore, you'll need to install the [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

To start the REST API, simply run the app.py by using an IDE or command line-wise with "python app.py".

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **flask**:  You must have [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/installation/) installed. If you have python already installed you can simply use "pip install Flask".

- **NumPy**:  You must have [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/absolute_beginners.html) installed. If you have python already installed you can simply use "pip install numpy".
